I whipped up these eggs as a pre-lunch snack and they turned out to be on-POINT. Worthy, to say the least, of a write up for the block. They are salty, creamy, tangy, and burn a low flame in your mouth. They could be eaten alone or served on some toasted home-made bread.

However you like 'em, get ready to dig-the-heck-in. These eggs make you beg.
